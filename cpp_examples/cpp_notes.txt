1. Standard Template Library containes Algorithms and Containers
2. Algorithms operate on data
3. Containers organize data. Containers are data structures
4. STL operate to separate containes and algorithms for the purpose of
   code reuse and simplicity
5. If there are N Algorithms and M containers, as containers has different 
   interfaces, number of all total implementations are N*M
6. Instead of implementing algorithms specific to each data structures or
   containers, it is simple to define unique interface using which algorithms
   operate on data. The interface is called iterators. Iterators are six basic
   types primarily. Containers has various degree of support for all the
   iterators. So naturallly total implementations are limited to
   N + C (some constant depend on iterators)
