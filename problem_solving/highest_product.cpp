/*

Given a vector of integers, find the highest product 
you can get from three of the integers.

The input vectorOfInts will always have at least three integers.

Gotchas
Does your function work with negative numbers? 
If vectorOfInts is [−10,−10,1,3,2] we should return 30 (which we get 
by taking −10∗−10∗3).

We can do this in O(n) time and O(1) space.
